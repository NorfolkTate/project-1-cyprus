                Cyprus remains a divided island - efforts to reunify the island have faced challenges, and the presence of United Nations peacekeeping forces continues.

                In June 2018, UN Secretary-General António Guterres appointed Jane Holl Lute as an adviser for Cyprus to assess
                conditions for resuming peace talks. Despite rounds of consultations, both Cypriot leaders and the guarantor parties
                (Greece, Turkey, and the UK) appeared distant. The opening of two checkpoints in November 2018 increased crossing points
                to nine. In February 2019, Greece and Turkey expressed a desire for dialogue, but tensions persisted due to disputes
                over oil and gas explorations in Cyprus' exclusive economic zone. Efforts in November 2019 to agree on "terms of
                reference" for negotiations were unsuccessful.
                
                As of January 2020, reunification prospects were questioned, and by February 2020, Northern Cyprus President Mustafa
                Akıncı's remarks about potential dependence on Turkey were met with condemnation. Throughout 2020, no breakthrough in
                unity talks occurred. Ersin Tatar, supporting a two-state solution, won the 2020 Northern Cypriot presidential election.
                Since then, both Turkey and Turkish Cypriots insist on a two-state solution, while Greece, Cyprus, the EU, and the UN
                maintain a federation as the only viable option.
                
                As of January 30, 2022, Tatar emphasized non-negotiable principles of sovereign equality and equal international status
                for Turkish Cypriots. On November 11, 2022, Northern Cyprus became a non-member observer state of the Organisation of
                Turkic States (OTS), adopting the official name "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," eliciting condemnation from
                Cyprus and the EU. On April 29, 2023, it became an observer member state of the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic States
                (TURKPA).

                Cyprus Unity Day, also known as Cyprus Independence Day, is celebrated on October 1st. It commemorates the day in 1960
                when Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule. The island was granted sovereignty, and the Republic of
                Cyprus was established as a result of the Zurich-London agreements, which involved the United Kingdom, Greece, and
                Turkey.
                <br>
                The celebration of Cyprus Unity Day typically involves various events, including official ceremonies, parades, cultural
                activities, and the display of national symbols. The day holds historical significance for the people of Cyprus,
                representing their struggle for independence and sovereignty.
