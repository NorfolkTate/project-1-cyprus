        <p>This site is dedicated to explaining and understanding the Cyprus Problem, a political and territorial dispute on the island of Cyprus, primarily involving the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
        communities. The conflict originated in the 20th century, leading to a divided Cyprus with the southern part
        predominantly governed by the Republic of Cyprus and the northern part controlled by the self-proclaimed Turkish
        Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey.</p>

        <p class="homepage">The Cyprus problem centers around the protracted political dispute on the island of Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean.
        Stemming from its colonial history, Cyprus gained independence from British rule in 1960, establishing the Republic of
        Cyprus with power-sharing arrangements between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority. However,
        intercommunal tensions led to violence in the 1960s, prompting a Turkish military intervention in 1974. This resulted in
        the de facto division of the island, with the northern part controlled by Turkish Cypriots and the southern part by
        Greek Cypriots, separated by the Green Line, monitored by UN peacekeepers.
        
        While the Republic of Cyprus is internationally recognized, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), declared in
        1983, is only recognized by Turkey. Numerous international efforts, including the Annan Plan in 2004, have aimed at
        finding a comprehensive resolution, but a lasting solution has remained elusive. The division continues to be a source
        of tension, with distinct political structures for each community, the presence of Turkish troops in the north, and
        disputes over property rights. The United Nations and the international community, including the European Union, have
        been involved in facilitating negotiations to reunify the island, but as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, a
        comprehensive resolution had not been reached. It's advisable to seek the latest information for any developments since
        then.</p>
