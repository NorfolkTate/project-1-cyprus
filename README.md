## User Experience (UX)

This site was originally designed to educate users on Cyprus history and on-going conflict.

As I moved through the building and deployment, I realised it would be better to feature Cyprus in a more positive light so I redesigned the website to Visit Cyprus.

The new website is deisigned to attract tourists to visit Cyprus and showcase the island as a holiday desitination.

The site should envoke joy and excitement.
